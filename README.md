# Shoppingly Front End App

This project was created with React, so when you download this repository, you will need to run the commands below if you want to use it locally. The project consists of functional components all arranged with their respective CSS. 

The Home components will let the page be updated across time so that new content can be added on each section. The same will happen to each of the shopping sections as content will be updated in the Backend Server (prices, garments, etc.)

Please bare in mind that you will need to change the hostbase name so that it connects with the Backend Server, which you can also find in this GitHub Profile. The project uses a little bit of bootstrap but it is mostly done with CSS.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

This will install the necessary packages and modules needed to run the app in a development server.

### `npm start`

This will run the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

For it to work you also need to run the Backend Server in a different port and make sure that you change the hostbase name in the project to the port you will be using to that server.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

This command builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Since the website is already hosted, there's no need to run this command.
